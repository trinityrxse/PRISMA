# PRISMA

Sensitivity analysis for various EFTs tested against SM only hypothesis
Uses Asimov data generated in MADGRAPH
Neural Networks are used to separate processes - our focus is on the VH to WWW channel
We also test validity of Higgs against bkg only hypothesis

TLDR: Simply run main.py and you will get all the results :)
